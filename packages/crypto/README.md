# @h3tag-blockchain/crypto

A comprehensive cryptographic library that combines traditional and quantum-resistant cryptographic operations for blockchain applications.

## Features

- Hybrid cryptographic operations (classical + quantum-resistant)
- Support for multiple quantum-resistant algorithms (Dilithium, Kyber)
- Extensive hashing utilities (SHA3, SHA256, RIPEMD160, etc.)
- Base58 encoding/decoding
- Key pair generation and management
- Native quantum cryptography module integration
- Configurable security levels

## Installation

```bash
yarn add @h3tag-blockchain/crypto

yarn install

yarn build
```

## Usage

### Basic Hash Operations

The library supports three security levels:

- NORMAL (1): Standard security level
- HIGH (2): Enhanced security for sensitive operations
- PARANOID (3): Maximum security for critical operations

The library includes built-in performance monitoring:
