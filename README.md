# H3TAG Blockchain

H3TAG Blockchain is an open-source blockchain implementation designed to be secure, scalable, and quantum-resistant. Utilizing a hybrid consensus mechanism that combines traditional Proof of Work (PoW) with direct voting, H3Tag Blockchain paves the way for a new era of decentralized technology.

## Key Features

- **Hybrid Consensus:** Combines PoW and direct voting for robust security and decentralized governance.
- **Quantum-Resistant Cryptography:** Leverages advanced cryptographic algorithms to anticipate future quantum computing threats.
- **Modular Architecture:** Organized as a monorepo with dedicated packages for API, CLI, core blockchain logic, cryptography, and shared utilities.
- **Developer Friendly:** Extensible design with clear contribution guidelines and still be implemented comprehensive testing across packages.

## Project Structure

- **`packages/api`**: RESTful API service for interacting with the blockchain. Provides endpoints for blockchain operations, transaction management, peer networking, and mining.
- **`packages/cli`**: Command-line interface for managing blockchain operations such as mining, submitting transactions, and wallet management.
- **`packages/core`**: Core blockchain implementation including block generation, validation, hybrid consensus (PoW + direct voting), and network synchronization.
- **`packages/crypto`**: A comprehensive cryptographic library implementing both classical and quantum-resistant methods.
- **`packages/shared`**: Shared utilities, configurations, and common type definitions used across all packages.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) version 16 or later
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nonameuserd/H3Tag-Core.git
   cd H3Tag-Core
   ```
2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```
3. **Build the Project**
   ```bash
   yarn build
   ```

## Testing

Each package includes tests relevant to its functionality:

- **Core Package Tests:** Block validation, consensus mechanism, and network synchronization (not yet implemented).
- **API & CLI Tests:** Integration and command-specific tests (not yet implemented).
- **Crypto Package Tests:** Quantum-resistant cryptographic operations and key management (not yet implemented).
- **CLI Tests:** Command-line interface tests (not yet implemented).
- **Shared Package Tests:** Utility functions and configuration validation (not yet implemented).

## Use Cases and Applications

H3Tag Blockchain is designed for a wide range of applications where security, scalability, and resilience are critical. Typical use cases include:

- **Decentralized Governance:** Leveraging hybrid consensus, token holders can directly influence network decisions, ensuring a truly democratic system.
- **Secure Financial Transactions:** With quantum-resistant cryptography, transactions are safeguarded against both classical and quantum attacks.
- **Supply Chain Management:** Immutable blockchain records facilitate transparency, traceability, and verification of product origins.
- **Decentralized Applications (dApps):** Provides a secure and scalable infrastructure for developing dApps that demand high reliability.
- **Data Integrity and Auditing:** Comprehensive logging and audit trails support regulatory compliance and strict security standards.
